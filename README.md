# Emotion Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project implements an emotion detection model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is designed to classify facial expressions into different emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and more.

## Overview

This project trains a CNN model to classify images of human faces into one of several emotion categories. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled facial expressions and can be used to detect emotions in real-time applications.

## Features

- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances the training dataset by applying various transformations.
- **Regularization**: Uses L2 regularization and dropout to reduce overfitting.
- **Callbacks**: Implements early stopping, learning rate reduction, and TensorBoard for monitoring training.

## Dataset

This project uses the FER-2013 dataset. Follow these steps to download and prepare the dataset:

1. **Download the `fer2013.csv` File**:
   - Download the FER-2013 dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013).
   - Alternatively, use the Kaggle CLI:
     ```bash
     kaggle datasets download -d msambare/fer2013
     ```
   - Extract the downloaded file to your project directory.

2. **Prepare the Directory Structure**:
   - Create the following directory structure:
     ```
     data/
     ├── fer2013/
     │   └── fer2013.csv
     ├── train/
     └── val/
     ```
   - Use scripts available online to split `fer2013.csv` into training and validation datasets, organized in subdirectories for each emotion class.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-detection.git
cd emotion-detection
```

### Step 2: Install Required Packages

Ensure you have Python installed, and then install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib
```

### Step 3: Set Up the Dataset

Place the dataset files in the `data/fer2013/` directory as described in the [Dataset](#dataset) section.

## Usage

### Step 1: Train the Model

Run the script to train the model:

```bash
python emotion_detection.py
```

### Step 2: Monitor Training

Use TensorBoard to visualize training metrics:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=./logs
```

### Step 3: Evaluate the Model

After training, the model will be saved as `emotion_detection_model.h5`. You can load and evaluate this model on new data or integrate it into an application.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using the following architecture:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Three convolutional blocks with increasing filter sizes.
- **Batch Normalization**: Applied after each convolutional layer.
- **MaxPooling**: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
- **Dropout**: Prevents overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during training.
- **Fully Connected Layer**: A dense layer with 512 units followed by a softmax output layer.

## Training

The model is trained with the following setup:

- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Metrics**: Accuracy
- **Callbacks**:
  - Early Stopping
  - Reduce Learning Rate on Plateau
  - TensorBoard for visualization

## Evaluation

After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation dataset. The final model is saved as `emotion_detection_model.h5`.

## Results

- **Validation Accuracy**: The final accuracy achieved on the validation set.
- **Validation Loss**: The final loss on the validation set.

You can further improve these results by fine-tuning the model, using more data, or experimenting with different architectures.
